* TODO Story

Seeing _hinges_ insecure on the door, We arrived at the core of SOS.
It _abruptly_ ran into my eyes when I opened the door that there was another
world inside the star! I was _awed_ by its _spectacular_ decorations, "_Awesome_!",
I sighed _spontaneously_.

It was too late when I realized that Tom somewhat had already disappeared.
I took steps into the world with fear. All of a sudden, I saw bloody liquid _spouted_
out of the center of hall, which, reminded me old experiences of _homicide_ I ran into.
_Trepidly_, I kept moving. Hearing _dismal_ melody with soft chuckles _haunted_ around, 
I stopped when I discovered a strange contemporary _vendor_ lain in the corner. 
Not ready to push a button, the machine xxx.
