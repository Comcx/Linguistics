#+DATE:   <2019-07-27 六>

:IDEAS:

Currently planning to organize this script by words.
Only vocabulary right now!

- Learning method
#+BEGIN_SRC scala
  1. Look at word meaning in English
  2. Read example sentences to understand
  3. Choose a simple sentence
  4. Read sentence        => Imagine scenes
  5. Desire of Expressing => Write sentences
  6. Listen sentence      => Imagine scenes
  7. Desire of Expressing => Speak sentences
  8. Modify the sentence  => Repeat ...
#+END_SRC

- Listening method

1. *Finish* one exercise directly, never try to look up solutions.
2. *Read* listening scripts, mark logical words inside.
3. Find all *positions* related to questions in the script based on following questions(mostly behind logical words).
4. *Analyse* options and finish the questions again(like working on a reading), finally find which sentence is misunderstood during listening.
5. *Check* answers, see amount of mistakes during listening and reading respectively, analyse reasons carefully.
6. *Read* listening script carefully, ensuring that we understand the content totally.
7. *Speak* after the audio => imitate pronunciations sentence after sentence => para after para => speak without material
8. Listen material with great care. Pay most attention on logical points and question points => repeat until we feel OK.





Still underwork ... :)

* TODO Story

Seeing _hinges_ insecure on the door, We arrived at the core of SOS.
It _abruptly_ ran into my eyes when I opened the door that there was another
world inside the star! I was _awed_ by its _spectacular_ decorations, "_Awesome_!",
I sighed _spontaneously_.

It was too late when I realized that Tom somewhat had already disappeared.
I took steps into the world with fear. All of a sudden, I saw bloody liquid _spouted_
out of the center of hall, which, reminded me old experiences of _homicide_ I ran into.
_Trepidly_, I kept moving. Hearing _dismal_ melody with soft chuckles _haunted_ around, 
I stopped when I discovered a strange contemporary _vendor_ lain in the corner. 
Not ready to push a button, the machine xxx.
